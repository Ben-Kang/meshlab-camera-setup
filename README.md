# Calibration file to Meshlab scene converter

This is a simple python script which transforms a file with camera calibration parameters (intrinsic, extrinsic and position) into a Meshlab scene.

The script uses four arguments: 
1. 3D mesh file name
2. File with calibration parameteres as in the sample file provided
3. File with the list of images names used for texturing
4. Name of the output Meshlab scene file

The inverse transformation will be available soon
