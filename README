This is a simple python script which transforms a file with camera calibration parameters (intrinsic, extrinsic and position) into a Meshlab scene.

The script uses three arguments: 
1. 3D mesh file name
2. File with calibration parameteres as in the sample file provided
3. Name of the output Meshlab scene file
